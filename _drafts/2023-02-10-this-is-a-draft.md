# This Is A Draft


Testing testing. This is a post. Just want to see how my drafts syncs up and the different ways I could work on them. I put the drafts in a _drafts folder. Then I run my local server bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts. They show up on the browser but not publicly for a preview. It failed when I didn't have a date in the yaml front matter. This is a much faster way to get a live preview of the changes. Just edit some text, save and refresh the browser and you can see changes without publicly pushing.
