Hi, I'm Bledley. I draw and paint and post about tech stuff and general interests. The idea with pigmentandpixels is to do one post art and one post tech, to keep my life in balance.
If you've ever enjoyed my work then please consider buying me a coffee and show your support.

**This blog is an ongoing project and still under construction.**
