Hi, I'm Bledley. I draw, paint and post about tech stuff and general interests. The idea with pigmentandpixels is to do one post art and one post tech, to keep my life in balance.
If you've ever enjoyed my work or found something useful then please consider buying me a coffee to show your support.

**This blog is an ongoing project and still under construction.**

I intentionally have no tracking, analytics, cookies, anything like that on this blog. Because of this I have no idea about visitor numbers so would love to hear from you via email. You can follow or comment with one of the social links at the bottom of the page. Subscribe with RSS or via my Substack to get new posts in your email inbox.
